# tbShellLib
twinBASIC Shell Library

Version 1.0.3
(c) 2022 Jon Johnson (fafalone)

This project aims to be a twinBASIC replacement for oleexp.tlb that is x64 compatible, due to the many problems using midl to create a 64bit tlb.

oleexp is a massive project and this currently represents just a small fraction of the interfaces, but I'm expanding it all the time.

As a twinPACKAGE, the regular addin modules can be built in.
